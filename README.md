# Machine Learning Pipeline for Binary Classification

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline aimed at binary classification tasks. It integrates various techniques and algorithms, including feature selection, preprocessing, and model optimization, to handle complex datasets and predictive modeling.

## Key Features
- **Automated Feature Selection:** Implements methods like mRMR, RFE, PCA, and Boruta for intelligent feature extraction.
- **Robust Preprocessing:** Includes missing value imputation, class balancing with ADASYN, undersampling, and scaling.
- **Model Optimization:** Leverages Randomized Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Multiple Model Support:** Supports models like CatBoost, XGBoost, RandomForest, and SGDClassifier.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates models based on F1-Score and AUC-ROC.
- **Learning Curve Analysis:** Visualizes the model's performance over varying training set sizes.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Imblearn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Boruta, mRMR
